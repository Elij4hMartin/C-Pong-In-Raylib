# C-Pong-In-Raylib
### Pong made in raylib coded in C++, and recompiled for web using emscripten.

+ Use [W] and [S] to move the paddle up and down
+ Press [Z] to reset the game.

This is a Pong game made in raylib (https://www.raylib.com/). It was coded in C++ and then recompiled using emscripten (https://emscripten.org/), playable copy on itch.io (https://palin-drome.itch.io/c-pong). 
The game contains basic VFX in the form of screen shake and sounds, more was going to be added but during development it was found that recompiling using emscripten made it difficult to make changes.
