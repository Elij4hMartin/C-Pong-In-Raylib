This is a Pong game made in raylib (https://www.raylib.com/). It was coded in C++ and then recompiled using emscripten (https://emscripten.org/).
The game contains basic VFX in the form of screen shake and sounds, more was going to be added but during development it was found that recompiling using emscripten made it difficult to make changes.
